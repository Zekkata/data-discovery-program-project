These notebooks are the results of the Discovery Program offered by the UC Berkeley's College of Computing, Data Science, and Society(CDSS) offered in the Spring of 2024, which aims to match students with various companies and organizations to accelerate research while providing students with real world experience.  In collaboration with the Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts Process Development Unit, centered in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, I(Kennedy) worked as a team of three in order to help process the data provided by the team convert it into a form understandable and usable format.

The goal of this particular notebook is to analyze the data from the treatment, hydrolysis and subsequent fermentation of corn stovers (stalks, husk, stem, leaf, etc) into biofuels (such as sustainable aviation fuel). Through data analysis, we hope to be able to help the scientists understand the effects and impacts of various feedstock variability on the efficiency of the production process in order to maximize the efficiency and yield of the process, and provide potential solutions to eliminate negative factors.

Objective: To present the data from the treatment process of corn stovers into a visually appealing and easily understood form.

The datasets are separated into 4, separated by year, with the 2019 dataset further separated into wholes or parts of the corn stovers.

Preliminary data cleaning were applied on the datasets; including the separation of elements present in the products into their own datasets. From there, various relationships were derived by creating box plots, correlation plots, violin plots, etc from the data. Of particular interest was the effect pretreating the stovers have on the Glucose and Xylose Yield. The yield were also separated based on part of the plant, to better understand the yield presented to us.

### Discovery Lab Fermentation
Collaborators: Kennedy Adam Goliman

Objective: To present the data from the fermentation process of corn stovers into a visually appealing and easily understood form.

In this next step in the biofuel conversion process, the byproducts are then fermented and further treated.

Our graphs are separated by batch, part of the plant, and treatment. This degree of separation helps the scientists pinpoint and isolate certain variables to better understand how those variables affect the end result.

Instead of the glucose and xylose yield, this time, we are more interested in the growth rate, sugar consumption, production of Bisabolene: That is, the process of fermentation itself.
